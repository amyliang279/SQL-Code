# SQL-Code
In these files, I have written SQL code to perform an exploratory data analysis, followed by some cleaning and data manipulation to the Pagila dataset. 

EDA Queries file holds the portion of code that delves deeper into the data where I explore and gather more information.
Cleaning and manipulating file is the portion of code that updates the tables for useful columns for future use.
